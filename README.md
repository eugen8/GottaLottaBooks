## Development process to make a change:
0) git pull to make sure you have the latest code
1) createa a branch for your card, e.g. `git checkout -b readme-dev-instr`  
2) do your coding (your actual work)
3) `git add -A`  and `git commit -a -m "adding instructions how to develop"` 
4) `git push origin readme-dev-instr`
5) Create a pull request 
6) Someone else reviews the request and approves it
7) You (the original developer) merge the code into the master and delete your branch.
